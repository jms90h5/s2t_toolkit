# Instructions for Uploading to GitHub

The project is ready for GitHub, but direct pushing from this environment isn't working. You'll need to download the archive file and manually upload it to GitHub.

## Step 1: Download the Archive

Download the file `standalone.tar.gz` from this directory.

## Step 2: Extract the Archive

```bash
tar -xzvf standalone.tar.gz
cd standalone
```

## Step 3: Upload to GitHub

There are two main ways to upload to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using git commands

```bash
# Initialize a new git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of WeNet Speech-to-Text project"

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/jms90h5/s2t_wenet.git
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Using GitHub's Upload Feature

1. Go to https://github.com/jms90h5/s2t_wenet
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop all the files from the extracted standalone directory
4. Add a commit message like "Initial commit of WeNet Speech-to-Text project"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## The Project Structure

The project has three implementations:

1. **Mock Implementation (Default)**: Simple mock API that doesn't use real models
2. **Python Implementation**: Uses Python with PyTorch to interface with real model files
3. **C++ Implementation**: Direct C++ API for optimal performance with real models

All implementations are fully documented in the README.md file.

Note: The large model file `final.zip` has been excluded from the archive to keep the size manageable. You'll need to download it separately or use the provided script to download it.
