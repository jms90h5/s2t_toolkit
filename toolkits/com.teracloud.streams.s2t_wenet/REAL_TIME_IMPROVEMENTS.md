# Real-Time Focused Improvements for WeNet STT Toolkit

## Corrected Design Philosophy

After review, the "batch processing" approach in the initial improvements was **fundamentally wrong** for a real-time speech-to-text system. Here's the corrected approach:

### ❌ What Was Wrong

1. **Batch Processing** - Accumulating multiple audio chunks before processing adds unacceptable latency
2. **Large Buffers** - Big circular buffers encourage batching behavior
3. **Delayed Processing** - Waiting for "optimal" batch sizes defeats real-time requirements

### ✅ Correct Real-Time Design

1. **Immediate Processing** - Process audio chunks as soon as they arrive
2. **Minimal Buffering** - Only buffer to align with model's chunk requirements (typically 10-200ms)
3. **Streaming Results** - Deliver partial results continuously for responsive UX
4. **Latency Focus** - Every design decision prioritizes low latency over throughput

## True Real-Time Implementation

### Core Processing Loop
```cpp
void processAudio(const int16_t* samples, size_t num_samples, uint64_t timestamp) {
    // Append to minimal buffer
    audio_buffer_.insert(audio_buffer_.end(), samples, samples + num_samples);
    
    // Process IMMEDIATELY when we have minimum chunk
    if (audio_buffer_.size() >= chunk_samples) {
        // Decode without waiting
        const char* result = wenet_decode(decoder, audio_buffer_.data(), 
                                         audio_buffer_.size(), 0);
        
        // Send result with latency measurement
        auto now = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
        parseAndSendResult(result, timestamp, now);
        
        // Clear processed audio
        audio_buffer_.clear();
    }
}
```

### Latency Optimization Techniques

1. **Lock-Free Audio Path**
   - Use atomic operations instead of mutexes in audio path
   - Single producer/consumer pattern

2. **Zero-Copy Where Possible**
   - Process audio in-place
   - Avoid unnecessary memory allocations

3. **Optimal Chunk Size**
   - Balance between model requirements and latency
   - Typically 100-200ms for good accuracy/latency trade-off

4. **VAD Integration**
   - Detect speech/silence to optimize processing
   - End utterances quickly on silence

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Latencies
- **Audio arrives**: 0ms
- **Chunk accumulation**: 100ms (configurable)
- **Model inference**: 20-50ms (depends on hardware)
- **Result delivery**: 5-10ms
- **Total latency**: ~150ms

### Real-Time Guarantees
- Process faster than real-time (>1x speed)
- Consistent latency (no spikes)
- Graceful degradation under load

## Monitoring Real-Time Performance

```cpp
struct LatencyStats {
    double avg_latency_ms;    // Should be < 200ms
    double min_latency_ms;    // Best case
    double max_latency_ms;    // Watch for spikes
    double p95_latency_ms;    // 95% of results under this
    double p99_latency_ms;    // 99% of results under this
};
```

## Use Cases Enabled

With proper real-time implementation:

1. **Live Captioning** - See words as they're spoken
2. **Voice Assistants** - Respond before user finishes speaking
3. **Real-Time Translation** - Translate while listening
4. **Interactive Voice Response** - Natural conversation flow
5. **Live Transcription** - Meeting notes in real-time

## Configuration for Different Scenarios

### Ultra-Low Latency (Voice Commands)
```cpp
config.chunk_ms = 50;          // 50ms chunks
config.enable_partial = false;  // Only final results
config.vad_silence_ms = 200;   // Quick utterance end
```

### Balanced (Live Captioning)
```cpp
config.chunk_ms = 100;         // 100ms chunks
config.enable_partial = true;   // Show partial results
config.vad_silence_ms = 500;   // Standard silence detection
```

### Accuracy-Focused (Dictation)
```cpp
config.chunk_ms = 200;         // 200ms chunks
config.enable_partial = true;   // Show progress
config.vad_silence_ms = 1000;  // Longer pauses allowed
```

## Conclusion

The key insight is that **real-time != batch**. Every millisecond counts in real-time applications. The corrected implementation:

- Processes audio immediately upon arrival
- Never waits to accumulate batches
- Measures and optimizes for latency
- Provides streaming partial results
- Maintains consistent, predictable performance

This is the difference between a system that feels responsive and one that feels laggy.
